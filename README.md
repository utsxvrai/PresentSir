# Present Sir

This system saves the precious time of students during hostel attendance by transforming the process to online mode. It makes the process easy and less cumbersome. Since it is based on hardcore coding and programming, it reduces the chance of debunking the system.

## How it works

[![DEMO VIDEO](https://img.youtube.com/vi/dtnpeKNBjqE/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/dtnpeKNBjqE)


All students have to do is scan a QR code on a scanner. Attendance is recorded without the student having to present themselves physically before the Hostel Superintendent.

## Benefits

This system provides a conducive environment for disabled and medically vulnerable students.

## Technologies used

This project was built using Python and OpenCV.
